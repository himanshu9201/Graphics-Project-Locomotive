Base code was taken from my own hw6, which was based on ex15, there are also a few lines of code adapted from ex21.

Everything was implemented using code. The smoke was done using my own sphere code.

Main things to pay attention to:
Movement of the rods with the wheels
Movement of trees/landscape especially with respect to the wheels. The wheels should not look like they are sliding on the rails.
Smoke movement/fade-away
General quality of geometry of the train itself (given that it is done entirely in code). The cab has been modified to have a more detailed and less boxy look.
Wheels on each side are 90 degrees out of phase like on a real locomotive, allows movement from any wheel position.
Spotlight on the front of the train. This is better seen when night mode is on, but is visible in day mode as well.

I also left the controls unlocked so you can zoom out really far to see how everything works, and look at things from all angles.
